## Deploying Firestore Rules

To deploy the Firestore rules, you need to have the Firebase CLI installed. If you don't have it, you can install it with the following command:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Once you have the Firebase CLI installed, you need to log in to your Firebase account:

```
firebase login
```

Then, you can deploy the Firestore rules with the following command:

```
firebase deploy --only firestore
```
